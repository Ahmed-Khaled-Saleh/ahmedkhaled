    "### Introduction.\n",
    "Computers memory can contain just two things, Data and instructions (some Lisp folks treat them similarily, but thit is another story). Data is stored as a sequence of zeros and ones (0s, 1s). The 0s represent the abscence of current or the low voltage, while the 1s represent the reverse. Computers own langauge is those 0s and 1s. Any computer cannot understand anything else.This language of 0s and 1s has its own branch of mathematics, called *boolean algebra* that can describe it very acccurately. But what makes programming able to produces such beautiful value (spreadsheets, Web browsers, ...etc), is that it  uses a tool called *abstraction* that enables programmers to work with higher level languages called **Progamming languages**. It's a universally accepted truth that working with higher level programming langauges is much less complex than working with own machine language(Sorry for some Embedded systems folks and retro enthusiasts). \n",

    "### Abstraction : The tool of the matter.\n",
    "We said that the higher level programming languages are enabled using a technique (or a methodology) called *Abstraction*. Abstractoin tries to decompose the problem into different layers and hides the unneccessary details between each subsequent layers. The following figure describes what abstraction is all about in terms of programming higher level langauges .\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src= \"Presentation1.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The technique shown above makes it easy to think about problems in terms of layers. Actually, The same approach could be applied to other disciplines as well. The general framework upon which Abstraction exist is the idea that *everything becomes understandable and easy to grasp the moment you break it to small pieces and try to understand them separately, then , recurisevley, combine the small pieces toghter to uncover the whole picture* . \n",
    "The high level programming languages layer *uses* the interface provided by the implementation part.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see from the figure that ***Abstraction*** hides a lot of details which otherwise could become a pain to work with. This makes the complexity a lot easier to handle. At the end of the day, programming is a very complex craft when it comes to designing and implementing large scale systems.But abstraction has a very bad side effect. Hiding a lot of details may result in a confusing understanding of the whole problem. This is a problem only when you are trying to do one of two things: \n",
    "- if the problem is so hard that you cannot really decompose it effectively .\n",
    "- if You are trying to innovate (at this level, you are in a must to break the abstraction level).\n",

    "One such higher level programming langauge is JavaScript, JS for short. It Was Created as a way to add programability to the [Netscape Navigator Web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator). Js together with HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS(Cascading Style sheets) are the tools reponsible for such huge boom of the web. This is the timeline for the releases of the Js versions : \n",
    "- Between 2000 and 2010, Js version three was the dominant version in browsers .\n",
    "- The fourth version abandoned in 2008 (actually, you can say that this was never released).\n",
    "- 2009 : The fifth version **EcmaScript 5** (theversion where JIT compilers were introduced to JS).\n",
    "- 2015 : The sixth edition **EcmaScript 6** (2015) A major release .\n",
