My name is **Ahmed Khaled**. Computer Science student, Software engineering is my field, but I prefer the word programmer to describe my job.

This is my Technical place on the internet where I write things (*both bad an good*) about things that are also (*bad and good and a combination of both*).


I write a range of topics from computer scince to mathematics and more. But the only theme that will stick is programming.
